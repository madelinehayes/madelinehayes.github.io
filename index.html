								<p>
									I am a dedicated multidisciplinary scientist with a passion for environmental problem solving. I previously worked at the University of Vermont Spatial Analysis Lab, where I researched the use of drone imagery and object-based image analysis for aquatic invasive species classification before moving to the Duke University Marine Robotics and Remote Sensing Lab in 2020. My research at Duke University focused on the applications of artifical intelligence and GIS to analyze drone imagery, including utilizing deep learning frameworks and remote sensing theory for seabird population assessments and water quality analysis. I have been a licensed FAA Part 107 Remote Pilot since 2018, and logged more than 100 flight hours.

								<b>Research Interests:</b> I am broadly interested in the intersection of emerging technology and environmental science, particularly deep learning in a geospatial context and Unoccupied Aircraft Systems. I hope to help bridge the gap between traditional research methods and automated methods by making this type of analysis accessible and effective for researchers from all backgrounds.
